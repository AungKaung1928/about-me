👋 Hey there! I'm Aung Kaung Myat

🚀 Mechanical Engineer | Aspiring Robotics Developer💡 Breaking into Robotics | Passionate about Automation & AI

🛠 About Me

I started my journey as a Mechanical Product Engineer, designing and optimizing products for real-world applications. But my curiosity for robotics, automation, and AI-driven solutions has pushed me to take a leap into the world of intelligent machines! Now, I’m on a mission to bridge the gap between mechanical design and smart automation.

🔹 Learning robotics fundamentals, control systems, and embedded programming🔹 Exploring ROS (Robot Operating System) & Python/C++ for robotics🔹 Passionate about CAD-to-Code integration (NX, CATIA → Simulation & Control)

🚀 My Learning Roadmap

✔️ Mechanical CAD & Design (NX, CATIA, SolidWorks)✔️ Basic Programming (Python, C++, MATLAB)🔄 Kinematics & Dynamics (Robot motion, control theory)🔄 ROS & Robotics Simulation (Gazebo, MoveIt)🔄 Machine Learning for Robotics

📌 Projects & Contributions

💡 Coming Soon! I’m currently working on my first robotics projects—stay tuned!📌 Mechanical → Robotics Transformation: Documenting my journey from mechanical design to robotics engineering.📌 ROS Simulations: Experimenting with robotic arms and autonomous navigation.

🎯 Goals

🚀 Build my first robotic arm simulation in ROS & Gazebo🎯 Contribute to open-source robotics projects📚 Master robot control & automation🌍 Connect with robotics engineers & AI enthusiasts
